## Question-1
1. ```*``` - is an operator used for multiplication. This operator can be used in two ways, One is using this as an multiplication operator for any two numbers(whatever the datatype), Two is that it is used for string replication.
2. ```'hello'``` is a string. Basically anything wrapped around ```' '``` is considered as string in pyhton.
3. ```-88.8``` is a float type number.
4. ```-``` is a operator used for subtraction.
5. ```/``` is also an operator used for division.
similarly, ```//``` is an operator which displays quotient, ```%``` is used to get reminder of a division.
6. ```+``` is an operator which adds.
7. ```5``` is value of integer datatype.

## Question-2
```spam``` is a variable because it is not wrapped around ```' '``` whereas ```'spam'``` is a string.

## Question-3
```integer```, ```float```, ```string``` are the 3 datatypes given in this chapter.

## Question-4
expression is a combination of operators and values(string,integer or number) say for example ```5 + 3``` is an expression which includes ```+``` operator and ```5,3``` values. Expressions are settled to single value. The above expression is settled to ```8``` after running the programme.

## Question-5
expression is a combination of operators which settles to single value where as statement is just a random statement or instruction.

 ## Question-6
 It pretty much do nothing to the statement ```bacon = 20```. The variable still contain 20, because we are not assigning the variable again.
>>> bacon = 20
>>> bacon + 1
21
>>> bacon
20

##  Question-7
```'spam' + 'spamspam'``` will return 'spamspamspam'
```'spam' * 3 ``` will return 'spamspamspam'

## Question-8
```100``` cannot be a variable because variables shouldn't with numbers.

## Question-9
int(), float() and str()

## Question-10
```'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'``` will return an error saying can only concatenate str to str. It's because we are using 99(int) along with the str. ```' I have eatten ' + '99 ' + 'burritos'``` will return I have eatten 99 burritos.
